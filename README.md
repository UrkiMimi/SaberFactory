## What is Saber Factory?
Simply said: An all-rounder when it comes to sabers.

Combine different saber parts like lego pieces.  
Everything is built around customization.  
Change the shape, shaders, material properties, textures and more of parts and sabers.

**You can use and customize both parts and custom sabers in saber factory**

## How do I install it
1) Download the first zip from [Here](https://github.com/Dennoo11/SaberFactory/releases)
2) Unpack it in your Beat Saber directory

## I want to create a saber
I highly recommend watching [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqpcNTpzW4A).  
The unity project can be found [here](https://github.com/ToniMacaroni/AssetCreationProject)


## I have made a noodle map where the player moves and I want the trails to not stretch
By default if the player moves in a noodle map the trail behaves like a real trail and becomes longer the faster the player moves.
Sometimes you might have a different vission for your map or the map is less playable with such a long trail.
If you don't know what I'm talking about, take a look at this comparison: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UP0SqtMcr1g  
You can enable "relative movement of the trail to the player" by using a settable settings in your map like this:
```
"_difficultyBeatmaps": [
        {
          "_difficulty": "Expert",
          ...
          "_customData": {
            "_requirements": [
              "Chroma",
              "Noodle Extensions"
            ],
            "_settings": {
              "_saberFactory": {
                "_relativeTrailMode": true
              }
            },
          }
        }
      ]
```
The settings group is `_saberFactory` and the field is `_relativeTrailMode` (which can be either `true` or `false`)
